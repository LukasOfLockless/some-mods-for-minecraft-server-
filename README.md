# This is that one minecraft server's description
so this is all about my server and how im ruining the different minecraft experience
got pregenerated 10k overworld, i think that should make the building and short distance exploration a pleasure. 
got:
helloworld
eatdirt eatsand
//stopped watching tutorials and began reading api documentation
name: killOP
sleep is fuky. no night skips. but you can lay in bed  and rest  crossing out insomnia 

what else?
ummm... so anyway.
/home /warp is easy and smells like p2w servers. /tavern is cool. i had this idea for before i even started coding them plugins. remember the good old days when using your hearthstone would get you back to your questig party? 
so the concept is that you have to build a tavern and the make some tevernblocks and then anyone who uses a tavern block would return to your tavern. with a 60 minute and 30 second cast time, moving would break the cast and set the cooldown.as well as a quick check to see if the tavern wasnt destroyed. i think it all centers around the CAMPFIRE or smt like that. 
creeper griefing is annoying and frustrating? if you answer yes to that question I am judging you on a personal level.
im thinking about some way to give the players the chance to tweak spawn rates of hostile mobs. not talking about insomnia. imho having a healthy diet keeps the demons out. maybe golden apples have something to do with decreasing spawnrate while rotten flesh increases it. i noticed smt funky. more mobs spawn on paper than on vanilla and i am genuinly happy about that. 
PIDGEON SERVER AND NO PIDGEON PLUGIN?!?!?!
k.
why haven't i done it yet? time is a limited resource and i like to nap.
